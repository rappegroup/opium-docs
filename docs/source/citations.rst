Citing OPIUM
========================================

At present, any work that uses OPIUM should be cite the following paper:

Rappe, Andrew M., et al. "Optimized pseudopotentials." *Physical Review B* 41.2 (1990): 1227.

In the future, the OPIUM team is planning on releasing a methods paper, and this page will
be updated accordingly when that happens.
