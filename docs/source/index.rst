OPIUM [#]_ is a program used to generate pseudopotentials for use in
first-principles calculations. The current stable release is v4.1.0, which
is available `here <https://github.com/rappegroup/opium>`_.

At present, OPIUM is capable of the following:

* Scalar-relativistic, fully-relativistic, and non-relativistic pseudopotential generation 
* Support for LDA, GGA, Hartree-Fock, hybrid [#]_, and range-separated hybrid [#]_ exchange-correlation (XC) functionals
* Constructing Optimized [#]_ (RRKJ) or Kerker [#]_ pseudopotentials 
* Partial core correction of Louie, Froyen and Cohen [#]_
* Test and generate and test pseudopotentials that support semicore states
* Applying augmentation operators designed non-local method of Ramer and Rappe [#]_
* Ghost state checking following the method suggested by Gonze, Stumpf, and Scheffler [#]_
* Automatic plotting of wave functions, potentials, and density using xmgrace 

OPIUM also supports the following output formats:

* ``.upf`` - Quantum ESPRESSO
* ``.recpot`` - CASTEP
* ``.fhi`` - ABINIT, JDFTx
* ``.ncpp`` - PWSCF
* ``.pwf`` - Bh
* ``.cpi`` - FHI98md

Legacy information regarding OPIUM can be found on the `old sourceforge page <https://opium.sourceforge.net/>`_.
